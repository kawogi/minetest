## CMake options

General options and their default values:

    BUILD_UNITTESTS=TRUE       - Build unittest sources
    BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=TRUE   - Build doxygen documentation
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   - Type of build (Release vs. Debug)
        Release                - Release build
        Debug                  - Debug build
        SemiDebug              - Partially optimized debug build
        RelWithDebInfo         - Release build with debug information
        MinSizeRel             - Release build with -Os passed to compiler to make executable as small as possible
    ENABLE_GETTEXT=ON          - Build with Gettext; Allows using translations
    ENABLE_SPATIAL=ON          - Build with LibSpatial; Speeds up AreaStores
    ENABLE_SOUND=ON            - Build with OpenAL, libogg & libvorbis; in-game sounds
    ENABLE_LUAJIT=ON           - Build with LuaJIT (much faster than non-JIT Lua)
    ENABLE_PROMETHEUS=OFF      - Build with Prometheus metrics exporter (listens on tcp/30000 by default)
    ENABLE_SYSTEM_GMP=ON       - Use GMP from system (much faster than bundled mini-gmp)
    ENABLE_SYSTEM_JSONCPP=ON   - Use JsonCPP from system
    ENABLE_UPDATE_CHECKER=TRUE - Whether to enable update checks by default
    INSTALL_DEVTEST=FALSE      - Whether the Development Test game should be installed alongside Minetest
    USE_GPROF=FALSE            - Enable profiling using GProf
    VERSION_EXTRA=             - Text to append to version (e.g. VERSION_EXTRA=foobar -> Minetest 0.4.9-foobar)
